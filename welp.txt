stuff

800 by 800
80 by 80 squares

3 colors
white = not hit
red = hit
black = vacant square

i think the list for the board should be

board = [[ _,_,_,_, --- 10 by 10, 

the player should have an easy time placing their ships
so raw.input stuff

board = []

for i in range 10
board append 0*5
print board
for i in range 10
print board i\
